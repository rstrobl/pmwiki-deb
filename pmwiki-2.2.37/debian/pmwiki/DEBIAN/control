Description: customizable and lightweight PHP-based wiki system using file-based storage
 PmWiki is a wiki-based system for collaborative creation and maintenance of
 websites. Pages can be edited either by the public or by small groups of
 authors.
 .
 PmWiki is written in PHP and allows to store the pages into files so that
 no database is required, though MySQL can be used optionally.
